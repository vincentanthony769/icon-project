  <h3><p>By Vincent Anthony</p></h3>
  <p>With her first solo tour since 2016, Beyoncé has broken records yet again thanks to this year’s "Renaissance World Tour.” Kicking off in Stockholm, Sweden on May 10, the 56-stop stadium trek began in Europe before landing stateside in July, ending on October 1st in Kansas City. The extravagantly opulent production echoed the album’s larger-than-life energy, which had radiating effects not only on Beyoncé’s stratospheric superstar status but also on the United States’ economy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/27/magazine/beyonce-renaissance-tour.html" target="_blank">The New York Times reports</a> that the tour generated an estimated $4.5 billion dollars, on par with the effect of the 2008 Olympics on Beijing. </p>
<p> Let's take a look at the "Renaissance World Tour" by the numbers.

<div>
<p>Beyoncé performed <a href="https://tour.beyonce.com/" target="_blank">56 sold-out stadium shows</a> on her "Renaissance World Tour," stopping in 39 cities throughout Europe and North America. It’s her longest trek since her 132-stop arena tour, “The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour,” in 2013 and 2014.</p>

    <p>Across the tour's 56 stops, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2023/10/04/beyoncs-renaissance-tour-ends-with-more-than-half-a-billion-dollars-earned-at-the-box-office/?sh=1d3446ce6e32" target="_blank">over 2.7 million tickets were sold</a> to Beyoncé's adoring "BeyHive." This total number of attendees is the largest of any Beyoncé tour to date. The veteran diva, who debuted in 1997 as the lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child, has certainly come a long way. Her first stateside solo tour in 2004 was a co-headlined alongside Alicia Keys and Missy Elliott and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Ladies_First_Tour" target="_blank">sold 280k tickets, grossing $19 million across 30 shows</a>.</p>

      <div>
      <p>The "Renaissance World Tour" grossed a total revenue of $592.4 million – more than her last two tours combined, which each made 49 stadium stops. The average ticket price was $213.</p></div></div>

    <div>  <p>Beyoncé's "Renaissance World Tour" is now the highest-grossing concert tour by a woman in music and is top ten overall. Next, she’s set her sights on another box office: movie theaters. <a href="https://beyoncefilm.com/" target="_blank">“RENAISSANCE: A Film by Beyoncé,” </a> a documentary about the tour, opens in theaters on December 1 and is poised for another record-breaking gross.</p></div>
